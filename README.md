Our **vision** at quill is to create a pen, or rather a smart pen, which will help users to save anything which can be drawn, written, i.e scribbled to any device of their choice

## Problem Statement:
We want to design a pen, or rather a smart pen, which will help users to save anything which can be drawn, written, i.e scribbled to any device of their choice.
 
## Why do we need this?
1.  While taking notes, 1000’s of trees are cut to mold into papers all over the world. This increases the carbon footprint and leading to emissions and hence ecological imbalance. We need
2. The users takes a lot of time to scribble the entire word and hence writing becomes time taking.
 
## Features:
 1. Write / Draw on any surface or on space, it's user’s choice! Once the save mode is on, the scribbled information will be transmitted to any device and any application of user’s choice.
 2. Anything which is scribbled can be modified with AI suggested autocompleted words or piece of designs which will help users to write swiftly and efficiently.
 3. Pen will have different modes for different usecases eg - writing mode, coding mode, designing mode,etc
 4. Pen will support different pads for writing example space pad, surface pad,etc
 5. Multilingual support

 
## Architecture:
### 1. Hardware: Wireless Pen with some sensors
  Pen Tip: The tip of the pen needs to be sensitive and capable of detecting pressure and movement.
  Sensors: Incorporate sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes to track the movement of the pen.
  Bluetooth Module: To enable communication between the pen and smart devices.
  Battery: Power source to operate the pen's electronics.
  Microcontroller: Controls the pen's functions, including data processing and communication with external devices.
  Memory Storage: To temporarily store the written data before transmitting it to smart devices.


### Software:
1. Windows Operating system Application: Windows app which will help convert the communicated information(from pen) to words or designs in the windows OS and hence can be used in various applications. These words can be complete with AI powered autosuggestion.
2. Mac OS Operating system Application: Same application but for Mac OS
3. IOS Operating System Application: Same application but for iOS
4. Android Operating System Application: Same application but for Android.
